# Liquibase Demo

Getting Started: https://docs.liquibase.com/start/get-started/liquibase-sql.html

---

The time has come. This repository holds my learning and testing scenarios for Liquibase in order to determine if it's adequate for a specific use case I've come accross in my day job, and if so, to make me profficient enough in setting it up in order to do it in an enterprise context.

## My Testing Scenario

## Evaluation Criteria
Since I'm evaluating Liquibase against other similar tools I have come up with a couple of features to take into consideration. Hopefully I'll have a good idea about each of them after following this project through to the end.

### POC Complexity
*how difficult is it to build a working demo*

### Cost
*What can I do with the free plans*

### SQL Server Compatibility
*Minimum SQL Server versions it works with*

### Impact on Developer Workflow
*How transparent will the transition be, from not knowing a new tool is being used in the pipeline to having to learn a brand new tool*

### Integration with Existing Databases
*How well can I take an existing, populated database and start using Liquibase?*

### Documentation
*How well is the project documented*

### Support
*Taking into consideration if the tool is still currently maintained and supported, and how much longer this support will last*

### Rollback
*How easy is it to rollback changes once they are commited*

### Reuse of Existing SQL Scripts
*How well can I reuse my existing SQL scripts repository*

### Maintenance of Integration
*How much has to be set up in order for CI/CD to work and how fragile is it*
